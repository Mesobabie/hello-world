# hello-world
This file is for learning how to use github and everything git
I am 27 years old. I'm about to embark on a journey with a goal to transition into tech and become a Data Engineer.
I enjoy learning new and interesting facts about history, human behaviour, psychology and results of studies. sharing new information with people gives me some sort of satisfaction especially when they're hearing for the firdt time. 
I'm strong and independent. Love my family and lots of laughter.
